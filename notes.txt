Whenever you modify your schema (like adding a new table/model, adding or removing a fields/columns, changing relationship), you need to first create/generate a migration and then apply migration to database.

npx prisma migrate dev --name init
The above command - generates a new migration and apply migration to database.
It is a combination of two commands:
1. npx prisma migrate generate --name init
2. npx prisma migrate apply

#Additional Information
--name init:
Specifies the name for the migration file. In this case, the migration file will be named init

#Understanding schema

Model Post {
    author    User     @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
    authorId  Int
}

author - is the virtual field which means 'post table' won't have a column name called 'author'. Instead it is used for generating or establishing a relationship b/w 'User table/modle' and 'Post table/modle'

npx prisma studio
the above command will help you to see your data. It is similar like mongodb compass
